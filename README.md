# svim — A Simple Extension for Vim Motions in the Browser

> *Why? Vimium exists.*

Why not?

But seriously — an extension like this requires significant permissions, essentially the ability to read everything I do in my browser. Past incidents (like the [surfingkeys issue](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys/issues/1796)) have shown that this level of access can easily be abused. Most other extensions didn’t quite scratch the itch for me — they’re either too complicated or too feature-heavy.

I really liked SurfingKeys, but I didn’t need all the power it offered. [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) felt even more complex.

And in the era of LLMs, this sounds like the perfect weekend project.



## Installation

This project is meant to me privacy focused, so installing from a store defeats the point.  
Code base is fairly simple. so any improvements can by  done in the extension code itself.

- git clone this project

- go to - `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
(yes i use firefox)

load open this manifest file


## LICENCE

This project is mostly fork of [vimkeybindings](https://github.com/autonome/vimkeybindings) , hence I am adding the GPLv3 licence to this.  

Though this repo has a lot of AI generated code, which i honestly don't know if compatible with GPLv3, if it is good enough for [Linus Torvalds](https://youtu.be/VHHT6W-N0ak)  on a GPLv2, this is good enough for a weekend project that not one gonna use except me.
