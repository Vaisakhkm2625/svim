# svim - Simple extention for vim motions in the browser


## why? vimium exists

why not?

but seriously, this extension needs serious accesses, like needed to be able to read 
everything i do in my browser - and previous incidents showed me that this power is definitely abused [surfingkeys issue](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys/issues/1796). most other extention didn't scratch the itch well for me, either complicated 

Even though i loved surfingkeys, i don't needed all the power it gives. And i find the  [tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) even more complicated.

And in the era of LLMS, this is a weekend project.


## Installation

This project is meant to me privacy focused, so installing from a store defeats the point.  
Code base is fairly simple. so any improvements can by  done in the extension code itself.

- git clone this project

- go to - `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
(yes i use firefox)

load open this manifest file


## LICENCE

This project is mostly fork of [vimkeybindings](https://github.com/autonome/vimkeybindings) , hence I am adding the GPLv3 licence to this.  

Though this repo has a lot of AI generated code, which i honestly don't know if compatible with GPLv3, if it is good enough for [Linus Torvalds](https://youtu.be/VHHT6W-N0ak)  on a GPLv2, this is good enough for a weekend project that not one gonna use except me.
